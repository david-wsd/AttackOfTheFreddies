# 👦 Attack of the Freddies 🍩

A wave-based defense game where you must feed donuts to incoming waves of hungry Freddies!

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click "START GAME" to begin
3. Click anywhere on the screen to throw donuts at the Freddies
4. Feed each Freddie enough donuts to satisfy them before they reach the bottom
5. Survive as many waves as possible!

## Game Mechanics

- **Lives**: You start with 3 lives. Lose a life when a Freddie reaches the bottom
- **Donuts**: Start with 10 donuts, regenerate slowly over time
- **Waves**: Each wave brings more Freddies that move faster
- **Health**: Later waves feature Freddies that need multiple donuts to satisfy
- **Scoring**: Earn points for feeding Freddies and completing waves
- **Texas Donut**: Feed 15 Freddies to charge up the massive Texas Donut special weapon that clears all Freddies on screen!

## Features

- Progressive difficulty - each wave gets harder
- Uses actual photo of Freddie with color variations
- Particle effects and animations
- Health bars for tougher Freddies
- Wave completion bonuses
- Beautiful gradient backgrounds with animated clouds

## Controls

- **Mouse Click**: Throw a donut toward the cursor position
- **Texas Donut Button** or **Spacebar**: Activate the Texas Donut when ready (feeds all Freddies on screen)

## Tips

- Aim carefully - donuts are limited!
- Prioritize Freddies that are closest to the bottom
- Watch for donuts to regenerate over time
- Tougher Freddies (later waves) need multiple hits
- Save the Texas Donut for when you're overwhelmed with many Freddies!
- The Texas Donut progress bar fills up as you fully satisfy Freddies

Enjoy defending against the Attack of the Freddies! 🎮
